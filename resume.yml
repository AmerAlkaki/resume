    summary: |
      Normal people living normal lives break laws all the time. Most Americans live their lives
      against the law, and don’t even know it.¹ You could get arrested for being in the wrong place
      at the wrong time, or even for accidentally doing something that you didn’t even know
      was illegal.

      We all make mistakes, but a stupid mistake shouldn't destroy your life. Unfortunately, the
      Criminal Justice System isn’t designed to handle mistakes, and a normal person like you or I
      could find ourselves in a legally-precarious situation purely by accident.

      Perimeter of Wisdom, LLC specializes in educating people accused of, or arrested for, a crime
      with our first book, “The First-Time Offender’s Guide to Freedom”. The author explains how
      your Miranda rights *actually* work, the right type of lawyer to look at for your case, and
      what the law can do to a friend or family member you've spoken to.

      Through our PCR Consultants business, we provide relief to those in the
      post-conviction/post-incarceration phase by helping them reduce their prison sentences with
      the Bureau or Prisons and/or the amount of time they spend on probation.

      After an unfortunate tour through the Criminal Justice System, it can be difficult to put your
      life back together and your past behind you; it can be difficult to move onward and upward
      with your life. Perimeter of Wisdom, LLC helps make that happen.

  - name: System and Methods for User Authentication across Multiple Domains (Provisional)
    publisher: WePay, Inc.
    releaseDate: "2015"
    summary: >
      A new approach is proposed that contemplates systems and methods to support verification of a
      user’s authentication information across multiple websites/domains owned and/or operated by
      different entities, which share users during a single session. When the user attempts to login
      to a first website/domain, he/she is required to provide authentication information in
      addition to user-id/password. An authentication platform is configured to generate and
      communicate the additional authentication information to the user and verify the additional
      authentication information the user provided to the first website/domain. When the user later
      attempts to access a second/unrelated website/domain, the verified additional authentication
      information is provided by the first website/domain to the second website/domain in the form
      of a signed cookie. The second website/domain parses the cookie and provides the additional
      authentication information to the authentication platform for verification without requiring
      the user to input it again at the second website/domain.

  - name: Hive-based Peer-to-Peer Network (WO/2008/033424)
    publisher: Foleeo, Inc.
    releaseDate: "2008-03-20"
    website: http://google.com/patents/US8103870
    summary: >
      A collaborative data transferring process can combine segments from all known servers and
      peer-to-peer (P2P) sources simultaneously, regardless of their native protocols. The process
      uses variable data block size that can be dynamically selected according to sizes provided by
      sources, e.g., according to the protocol of the source, and can generate hash values or
      validation codes on the fly so that compliance with validation techniques (if any) of other
      protocols is not required. The process may be classified as a P2P protocol, although it also
      contains centralized elements. Machine language implementations and low syntax overhead allow
      file exchanges over a homogeneous network with high throughput and low bandwidth consumption.
