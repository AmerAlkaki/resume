# Ryan Parman

I have been building things for the web since 1998. I’ve lived through the browser wars (both of them), I’ve worked on multiple high-profile projects, and have maintained server clusters that have had hundreds of millions of dollars flowing through them (figuratively, of course).

I have experience with startups, not-so-startups, and Fortune 500s. I have lots of experience working with large teams, as well as across teams, to get projects completed.

I have experience taking the long-view on things that people might not understand today. I understand that “perfect” is the enemy of “done”, but also that we “must not ship crap.” I understand that the minimum viable product of a motorcycle isn’t  the wheels or the chassis, but a tricycle.

I excel in teams that care about the customer or end-user, and want to make things better tomorrow than they are today. I excel in teams where I am given the latitude to make decisions, and work across teams to deliver the best possible customer experience. I excel in teams where merit and experience trump job titles.

Let’s work together to create something amazing.
