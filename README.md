## Summary

### Professional Blurb

“Ryan Parman is experienced at nearly every level of the web stack, from the
frontend to the backend, to the systems, servers, and ops. He is an engineer
who is fiercely passionate about the user experience and interaction of a
product. He inherently understands that the customer is the single most
valuable asset an organization can have, and is driven by the unrelenting
pursuit of customer-driven focus, ideals and user experience.”

### If we were having coffee…

I have been building things for the web since 1998. I’ve lived through the
browser wars (both of them), I’ve worked on multiple high-profile projects, and
have maintained server clusters that have had hundreds of millions of dollars
flowing through them (figuratively, of course).

I have experience with startups, not-so-startups, Fortune 500s, and heavily-used
open-source projects. I have lots of experience working with large teams, as
well as across teams, to get projects completed.

I have experience taking the long-view on things that people might not
understand today. I understand that “perfect” is the enemy of “done”, but
conversely that “we must not ship crap.” I understand that the “minimum viable
product” version of a motorcycle isn’t the chrome wheels or a nice chassis, but
a tricycle. I understand that it’s easy to ship something, but hard to maintain
it. You need diligence, focus, patience, and lots of really good documentation
to be successful.

I believe that for any software that you write, documentation is worth 50% of
your grade. If you have spectacular code, but you skip the documentation (or
write really bad documentation), you get an _F_ . I also believe that your code
doesn't function unless an automated test confirms it. I frequently ask myself,
“What happens to the projects I own if I get hit by a bus? How screwed is my
team?”

I excel in teams that care about the customer or end-user, and want to make
things better tomorrow than they are today. I excel in teams where I am given
the latitude to make decisions, and work across teams to deliver the best
possible customer experience. I excel in teams where merit and experience trump
job titles.

Let’s work together to create something amazing.
